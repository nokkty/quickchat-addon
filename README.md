# PADChat

**PADChat** is a World of Warcraft addon that brings quick-chat to gamepad and controller players. Inspired by the Voice Game System (VGS) from Tribes 2, it lets you send tactical callouts, group readiness checks, and social emotes in seconds, without touching a keyboard.

## Why?

I've played World of Warcraft with a controller for many years, and communicating with other players has always been the biggest drawback. Now that World of Warcraft: Forever supports controllers, more people are playing this way, and this addon is my attempt to ease that frustration. I hope it helps you!

## Features

- **Button combos:** Navigate chat menus up to 4 presses deep using the face buttons (**A / X / Y** or **Cross / Square / Triangle**).
- **Context tabs:** Tap **LB / RB** (bumpers) to switch between **Say**, **Group**, and **Battleground** channels.
- **Built-in editor:** Customize messages, categories, emotes, and `{location}` placeholders from the minimap button.
- **Normal and compact modes:** Pick the overlay size that suits your UI.
